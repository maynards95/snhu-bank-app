# bankApp
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  
	This project allows a user to determine their EOY for a given investment. This already has all calculations done so all the user needs to input is the interest, monthly deposit amount, number of years, and initial deposit. This simplifies the process for the user.
What did you do particularly well?
  
	I was able to maintain a clear .main file which will allow greater maintainability and resuability. It also makes it much easier to read and understand.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  
	I could style the table better and change the color of the output so it's prettier to read. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  
	The table with deposits was the most challenging because initially I had issues with my calculations. Stackoverflow was helpful in learning how to format the output. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  
	Creating classes, getter and setter methods. More practice with OOP which will transfer to other languages and my professional work in the future. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  
	By practicing and implementiung OOP principles. Declaring variables in the .h file and defining in the Bank.cpp file allowed the Bank.main to be very easy to read and adaptable. I would just need to change some of the methods in the Bank.cpp file without touching anything else.
